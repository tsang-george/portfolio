title: Personal Roadmap to be a Full Stack Data Analyst
---
Knowledge is power. Data analytic skills are empowering. I definitely feel that way. The Data Analytics programme I am studying in is coming to the end in less than 2 weeks. However, there is still a long way to go on becoming a competent data analyst with a specialization in visualization which is capable from data collection stage all the way to visualization and presentation.

I want to become one because there are a few projects (including some geospatial things) that I want to do and I want the capability of executing them alone. I figured that leveling up my technical knowledge and skills has the top priority at this moment. For this reason, I laid down a personal roadmap for 2022 in the form of Gantt chart with focus on certain essential skills. I knew none of the skills before enrolling in the programme, but I am pleased that I am currently at the level stated below.

1. Python - advanced beginner
2. R - advanced beginner
3. MySQL - advanced beginner
4. MongoDB - to be acquired
5. Power BI - intermediate
6. Tableau - intermediate
7. ArcGIS - to be acquired
8. Web Scraping - to be acquired

#### In 2022, I want to be able to achieve the following:
