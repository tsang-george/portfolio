title: Personal Roadmap to be a Full Stack Data Analyst
---
Knowledge is power. Data analytic skills are empowering. I definitely feel that way. The Data Analytics programme I am studying in is coming to the end in less than 2 weeks. However, there is still a long way to go on becoming a full stack data analyst that is capable of all aspects, from data collection to visualization.

There are a few projects (including some geospatial things) that I want to do and I want the capability of executing them alone. I figured that leveling up my technical knowledge and skills has the top priority at this moment. For this reason, I laid down a personal roadmap for 2022 in the form of Gantt chart with focus on certain essential skills.

#### In 2022, I want to be able to achieve the following:

I knew none of these skills before enrolling in the programme but I am please I reached my current state, which is shown as the half block before January.

Some of the tasks above will be achieved through courses offered by Microsoft, Google and AWS. I would be a good idea to learn a few more Python libraries too, e.g. GeoPandas, PySal, TensorFlow, XGBoost, Dash, etc, but I have no definite schedule for them.
