### George Tsang
Currently studying Data Analytics for Business Decision Making at Durham College in Oshawa, I have a passion in data visualization and anything biology. I have a bachelor's degree in biology, worked in the legal, jewellery and music industries. I am also very into film photography recently, which explains my interest in visual communication. This mixed background and the diverse exposures that come with it allow me to see things from many perspectives.

My capstone project is analyzing the impact of commercial logging to biodiversity in BC. In the future, I hope use my data analytic skill on wildlife conservation for NGO or the science communities. To do that I will have to learn and improve a number of skills. Below is my learning plan and the future state I hope to reach in a year.

I am grateful that I have come so far from knowing none of them before the data analytics programme started to being able to conduct the project on my own now. I hope to walk further in this path.
